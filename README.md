# Plant Log

## Inspiration
Having house plants is an excelent way to decorate your home and give it life.  However, it can be difficult to maintain these plants.  That's where we come in!  Using this site you can easily keep track all of your house plants.  This includes what type of plant it is, how often you need to water it, and how much sunlight it recieves.  

## How to use
Using the Plant Log is easy.  First you want to click [**here**](https://plant-water-log-git-overhaul-jacksense.vercel.app/).  Once you're online, you will be presented with the Home page.  The Home page is where you will find all your lovely plants and their needs.  

To add a plant, click on the 'Create New Plant' button.  From there, you can fill out the form with all your plant's specifications.  Once you have finished filling out the form, hit "Add new plant" and then click "Home."  Now that you're back at the home page, you should see your newly added plant!  

The Home page can be used for more than just viewing.  If you made a mistake or something has changed, you can click 'edit' on any of your plants and update any of the information.  Or if for whatever reason you no longer need to track a plant, you can click 'delete' and remove the plant from your Plant Log entirely.
